I'm teaching myself HTML/CSS/JavaScript (and some jQuery) with the goal of being able to build things like Chrome extensions for fun in the future. Eventually I want to learn some angular.js, node,js, etc., before moving on to Flask or Django.

This website is a nice testing ground for all the future project ideas I have and has the added bonus of being a portfolio site I can put my resume, education, projects, etc. on. It's constantly being updated and improved as I learn more.
